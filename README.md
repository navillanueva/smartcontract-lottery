# FCC Smartcontract Lottery Lesson 9

These are my notes and comments that I took as I followed along the course taught by Patrick Collins. By no means is the code found in this repo my creation. If you want to access a better and more clear code, check the [original repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-4-remix-fund-me) where everything is posted.

I am just uploading this to save all of my notes for further study and review of what I learnt during the course.
